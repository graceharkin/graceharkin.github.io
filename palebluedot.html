<h1>Pale Blue Dot</h1>
<h2>typography // print // publication<h2>
<p>During my undergraduate studies I took a typographics class in which we were assigned to design some typography of any literary excerpt.
  We also had to include a sleeve for the booklet. I chose the first chapter of Carl Sagan’s book “Pale Blue Dot.”
  He discusses Voyager I's photo taken of Earth in 1990, which depicted Earth from the farthest away it had ever been seen, the technicalities of
  such an endeavor, the technology, the human power needed, and the implications of understanding how "small" we are in the universe.
<br><br>
  I chose this excerpt because when I was 10 years old I saw the movie adaptation of Carl Sagan's book "Contact" and it forever changed my life.
  It was the first time I was truly in awe of and also felt a part of the cosmos.
  The first chapter of Pale Blue Dot hits on the I way felt: insignificant, lonely, yet a part of something so incredibly large and wonderful.

<p> The sleeve directly contrasts the cover; after pulling away at the machine-like sleeve you find yourself left with the very human title.
  It’s understated and hidden at first. Much like the way Carl Sagan pulled back the curtain of the cosmos for everyday people; he did not
  diminish the awesomeness of the universe but he did make it more approachable.

<p>The booklet begins its journey at the point “You are here.” From there the typography at first remains contained within the bottom-right space created by the intersection of the dotted lines. Slowly, the typography begins to break apart, spread out, vary in weight, kerning, and style.

    <p>The type breaks and varies more and more and becomes less dense. There is less and less type as you along.
My design concept for the booklet was to depict the contrast between the technical, scientific explanations and the introspective, contemplative voice that Sagan utilizes.</p>

<p>The booklet ends after the quote “It has often been said that astronomy is a humbling, character-building experience. There is no better technological demonstration of the folly of human conceits than the distant image of our tiny world. It underscores our responsibility to preserve and cherish this blue dot, the only home we have.”
The last line ends back at the intersection, which is smaller and further in the corner. The type is all alone after that journey, is much like the Voyager I. Growing more and more distant from the Earth.
